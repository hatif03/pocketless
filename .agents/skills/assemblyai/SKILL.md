description: Use when implementing speech-to-text, audio transcription, real-time streaming STT, dictation (spoken notes turned into cleaned-up text), audio intelligence features, or voice AI using AssemblyAI APIs or SDKs. Use when user mentions AssemblyAI, voice agents, transcription, dictation, speaker diarization, PII redaction of audio, LLM Gateway for audio understanding, or applying LLMs to transcripts. Also use when building voice agents with LiveKit or Pipecat that need speech-to-text, or when the user is working with any audio/video processing pipeline that could benefit from transcription, even if they don't mention AssemblyAI by name.

# AssemblyAI Speech-to-Text and Voice AI

AssemblyAI provides speech-to-text APIs, audio intelligence models, and an LLM Gateway for applying language models to transcripts. This skill corrects common mistakes that training data gets wrong — deprecated APIs, discontinued SDKs, and non-obvious auth patterns.

## Authentication

**All endpoints use the same header:**
```
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```
**NOT** `Authorization: Bearer ...` — just the raw API key, no Bearer prefix. This is the #1 mistake.

## Base URLs

| Service | US | EU |
|---------|----|----|
| REST API (async) | `https://api.assemblyai.com` | `https://api.eu.assemblyai.com` |
| Sync STT API (≤120s) | `https://sync.assemblyai.com` (global default, routes to nearest; `https://sync.us.assemblyai.com` for US residency) | `https://sync.eu.assemblyai.com` |
| Dictation API (≤120s, transcript + rewrite) | `https://dictation.assemblyai.com` (global default, routes to nearest; `https://dictation.us.assemblyai.com` for US residency) | `https://dictation.eu.assemblyai.com` |
| LLM Gateway | `https://llm-gateway.assemblyai.com/v1` | `https://llm-gateway.eu.assemblyai.com/v1` |
| Streaming v3 | `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws` | `wss://streaming.eu.assemblyai.com/v3/ws` |
| Streaming v2 (legacy) | `wss://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/ws` | — |
| Voice Agent API | `wss://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/ws` | `wss://agents.eu.assemblyai.com/v1/ws` |

**Streaming EU region**: As of March 2026, the EU region moved from AWS eu-west-1 (Ireland) to AWS eu-north-1 (Stockholm). The customer-facing endpoint host (`streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`) is unchanged.

## SDKs

| Language | Install | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Python | `pip install "assemblyai>=1.5.4"` | Active |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `npm i assemblyai@^4.41.1` | Active |
| Ruby | `assemblyai` gem | Active |
| Java | `assemblyai-java-sdk` | **Discontinued April 2025** |
| Go | `assemblyai-go-sdk` | **Discontinued April 2025** |
| C# .NET | `AssemblyAI` NuGet | **Discontinued April 2025** |

**Only Python, JS/TS, and Ruby SDKs are maintained.** For Java, Go, or C#, use the REST API directly.

### SDK versions

**Install the latest of each: Python `1.5.4` (Sept 14, 2026) and Node `4.41.1` (Sept 11, 2026).** These are the current releases and the first pair to carry the **Dictation API** (`DictationTranscriber` / `client.dictation`, added in Python 1.5.2 and Node 4.40.0), streaming sync uploads (`transcribe_live()` / `transcribeLive()`), the Node `client.llmGateway` service (4.38.0), and the `universal-3-6` streaming model. The two SDKs version independently (the JS/TS SDK has been on 4.x since December 2023), so there is no shared version number to match on; match on the release carrying the same change instead.

Always check the installed version (`pip show assemblyai` / `npm ls assemblyai`) before writing code against `DictationTranscriber` or `client.dictation` in an existing project — anything older than the versions above has no dictation surface.

If you are reading this well after Sept 2026, take whatever is newest — `pip install -U assemblyai` and `npm i assemblyai@latest` — rather than pinning the versions above. The absolute minimum that still has the current API surface is **Python 1.0.0** (Aug 14, 2026) and **Node 4.37.0** (Aug 28, 2026), the pair that removed LeMUR; anything older than that is a different SDK generation.

**Python 1.0.0 breaking changes** — training data almost always shows the 0.x forms:

| 0.x | 1.x |
|-----|-----|
| `aai.Lemur(...)` and every `aai.Lemur*` name | **Removed.** Feed `transcript.text` to the LLM Gateway |
| `pip install "assemblyai[extras]"` | **Removed** — the `[extras]` option now fails. Use `pip install -U assemblyai` |
| `from assemblyai.extras import MicrophoneStream` | **Removed.** The SDK no longer captures mic audio — use `pyaudio`/`sounddevice` and pass 16-bit PCM chunks to `stream(...)` |
| `StreamingClient`, `StreamingClientOptions`, `StreamingParameters` | Renamed `RealTimeTranscriber`, `RealTimeTranscriberOptions`, `RealTimeParameters`. The old names are still bound to the same objects (nothing deprecated), but write the new ones |

Nothing else breaks: `aai.settings.api_key`, `aai.Transcriber()`, and the flat import paths (`assemblyai.transcriber`, `assemblyai.sync`) all still work, and no signature was narrowed. New in 1.x and worth adopting — `api_key=` on every transcriber and client constructor, `poll_timeout=` on `transcribe()`, `async with AsyncTranscriber(...)`, `AsyncSyncTranscriber`, and versioned imports (`assemblyai.prerecorded.v2`, `assemblyai.sync.v1`, `assemblyai.streaming.v3`). See `references/python-sdk.md`.

**Node 4.37.0 breaking change:** `client.lemur`, `LemurService`, and all Lemur request/response types are removed (the LeMUR endpoints answer 404). No renames, no signature changes — the rest of a 4.36.x codebase is unaffected.

**`universal-3-6-pro`** appears in the streaming model enums added by Python 1.1.0 (`assemblyai.streaming.v3.SpeechModel`) and Node 4.37.1 (`StreamingSpeechModel`). It is **not yet in the public docs or the model picker** — keep using `universal-3-5-pro` until it is announced.

## Speech-to-Text Models

**`universal-3-5-pro` is the model to use across the board.** It is GA for **both** realtime/streaming and pre-recorded/async transcription. Use it everywhere by default; drop to `universal-2` only for cost or for languages outside Universal-3.5 Pro's 18. `universal-3-pro` (async) and `u3-rt-pro` (streaming) have both been **superseded by `universal-3-5-pro`** and removed from their model lists/enums.

**Default-model transition (async):** accounts created on/after **July 7, 2026** already default to `["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` when `speech_models` is omitted (and cannot request `universal-3-pro`/`universal`). All remaining accounts switch on **September 2, 2026** — from that date, an omitted/empty/singular `speech_model`, or `["universal"]`, routes to `universal-3-5-pro`; `speech_models: ["universal-3-pro"]` returns an **error**; and streaming `u3-rt-pro` connections are silently redirected to `universal-3-5-pro`. Pin `speech_models` explicitly if you need deterministic behavior across the transition.

### Pre-Recorded

| Model | Languages | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Universal-3.5 Pro** (recommended default) | 18 (auto-falls back to Universal-2 for the other 99) | Flagship: best accuracy, fastest, native code-switching across its 18 languages, contextual `prompt`, keyterms up to 1,000 words |
| **Universal-2** | 99 | Cost-effective; broadest language coverage; keyterms up to 200 words; fallback for languages outside Universal-3.5 Pro's 18 |

On `POST /v2/transcript`, `speech_models` is a priority list with fallback — the documented default is `["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` (already live for accounts created on/after July 7, 2026; all accounts from September 2, 2026 — see the transition note above). Universal-3.5 Pro handles its 18 languages and automatically falls back to Universal-2 for the rest. The async `speech_models` enum now accepts only `universal-3-5-pro` and `universal-2` (`universal-3-pro` has been removed, superseded by `universal-3-5-pro`). The **singular** `speech_model` field rejects current model names with a 400 (legacy names `best`/`universal` still route to the default; `nano` is no longer documented). Universal-3.5 Pro supports contextual `prompt` (a plain-language *description* of the audio) and `keyterms_prompt` (up to 1,000 terms; native in-model biasing — Universal-2's keyterms are phonetic post-processing, ≤200 terms, English only, terms shorter than 5 or longer than 50 characters ignored). Check the `speech_model_used` response field to see which model actually ran.

### Streaming

| Model | Languages | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **universal-3-5-pro** | 18 | **Recommended default for new realtime/streaming code** — next-gen flagship: more languages, native code-switching, improved prompting + conversational context |
| **universal-streaming-english** | 1 (English) | Voice agents, ~300ms latency |
| **universal-streaming-multilingual** | 6 | Per-utterance language detection |
| **u3-rt-pro** | 6 | **Legacy** — Universal-3 Pro Streaming, **removed July 2026** from the model picker and streaming spec `speech_model` enum. Superseded by `universal-3-5-pro`. Still seen in older code |
| **whisper-rt** | 99+ | **Legacy** — removed from the public model picker (June 2026) and the streaming spec enums, but still functional via `speech_model: whisper-rt` for broadest streaming language coverage, auto-detect only |

For realtime/streaming STT, use `speech_model: "universal-3-5-pro"` by default. The raw API parameter is optional and defaults to `universal-3-5-pro`; set it explicitly when pinning behavior or using an SDK that requires the field. The streaming spec `speech_model` enum now lists only `universal-3-5-pro`, `universal-streaming-english`, and `universal-streaming-multilingual`. The `mode` connection param (universal-3-5-pro only) trades off accuracy vs latency: `min_latency`, `balanced` (default), `max_accuracy`.

### Medical Mode (Add-On)

`domain: "medical-v1"` enables Medical Mode — an add-on that improves accuracy for medical terminology (medications, procedures, conditions, dosages). Works with both pre-recorded and streaming models.

- **Pre-recorded:** Universal-3.5 Pro (`domain: "medical-v1"` in request body), Universal-2
- **Streaming:** universal-3-5-pro, universal-streaming-english, universal-streaming-multilingual
- **Supported languages:** English, Spanish, German, French (4 languages only)
- Billed as a separate add-on. If used with an unsupported language, the API ignores `domain` and returns a warning — transcript still completes and you are NOT charged for Medical Mode.

### Prompting (Universal-3.5 Pro)

`prompt` and `keyterms_prompt` are **complementary** — use either, or both together. Neither changes the output format, and both work the same way for **streaming and async** (`POST /v2/transcript`). Transcription behavior (verbatim, punctuation, formatting) is built in and managed by AssemblyAI.

- **`prompt`** (string; length cap varies by API — streaming ≤1750 chars, async up to ~1,500 words, Sync STT ≤4096 chars): a plain-language **description of the audio** — its domain, scenario, or full details. It carries *context*, **not instructions** — formatting/behavioral commands (punctuation rules, "transcribe verbatim", "don't…") are not supported and are ignored. The model stays grounded in the audio: irrelevant or only-partially-applicable context won't make it insert words that weren't spoken, so you can safely send the same description on every session/segment.
- **`keyterms_prompt`** (string[]): an explicit list of names/brands/domain terms to boost. Streaming: up to **100** terms, ≤50 chars each. Async: up to **1,000** terms.

**Contextual prompt — three levels of specificity** (use the least specific that covers your case):

| Level | Length | Contains | Example |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| Domain | 2–5 words | The field only | `Medical consultation call.` |
| Scenario | 5–15 words | What the call is about | `Cardiology consultation about chest pain symptoms.` |
| Detailed | 20–50 words | Names, products, identifiers | `Cardiology consultation between Dr. Smith and a patient about recurring chest pain, ECG results, and hypertension medication.` |

**Best practices:**
- **Start with no `prompt` and no `keyterms_prompt`** — the model is optimized out of the box. Add context only for domain vocabulary it gets wrong, starting at the broadest level.
- Write plain, complete sentences that *describe* the recording; keep it to one short block, not a keyword list (that's what `keyterms_prompt` is for).
- Keyterms: use exact spelling/capitalization; avoid common words (over-inclusion causes overcorrection/hallucination).
- Specify language via `language_code` (preferred) or by naming it in the prompt (e.g. "Spanish customer support call…").
- Streaming: update both mid-session via `UpdateConfiguration`; a new keyterms array replaces the prior set, `[]` clears it.

## Sync STT API (short-form audio, ≤120s)

A separate synchronous endpoint for short clips — send audio in one HTTP request, get the transcript back in the response. **No polling, no transcript ID, no `upload` step.** Fully launched (GA) July 14, 2026 at $0.45/hr. Ideal for voice-message transcription, short call recordings, or voice-agent pipelines that do their own turn detection and submit completed utterances.

- **Endpoint:** `POST https://sync.assemblyai.com/v1/transcribe` (routes are versioned as of July 2026 — the unprefixed `/transcribe` still works for legacy clients, but new code should use `/v1/`). Global host routes to nearest region; use `sync.us.assemblyai.com` / `sync.eu.assemblyai.com` for data residency
- **Required header:** `X-AAI-Model: universal-3-5-pro` (the only sync model in the SDKs; `u3-sync-pro` is a legacy accepted value)
- **Auth:** `Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY` (Bearer prefix optional here, unlike the async REST API; or pass `?token=YOUR_API_KEY`)
- **Body:** `multipart/form-data` with an `audio` part (`Content-Type: audio/wav` or `audio/pcm`) and an optional `config` JSON part
- **`config` fields:** `prompt` (≤4096 chars), `keyterms_prompt` (string[] — **renamed from `word_boost` in July 2026**; the aliases `word_boost` and `keyterms` are still accepted), `conversation_context` (string or string[] — prior conversation turns oldest-first, for continuity across a multi-turn conversation; oldest dropped when over the context budget), `language_codes` (ISO 639-1 list; singular `language_code` also accepted, default `en` — steers the default prompt toward the named language(s); **ignored when a custom `prompt` is set**), `timestamps` (bool, default `false` — **opt-in** per-word `start`/`end` in ms via forced alignment; omitted from the response if the aligner is unavailable, never estimated), and for `audio/pcm` also `sample_rate` + `channels` (required for raw PCM; WAV reads them from its header). **Unknown `config` fields are rejected with a 400** — don't pass async-API params here
- **Audio limits:** 80ms–120s, ≤40MB, 16-bit only, mono/stereo (stereo down-mixed), sample rates 8000/16000/22050/24000/32000/44100/48000 Hz
- **Response:** `{ text, words[{text, start?, end?, confidence}], confidence, audio_duration_ms, session_id, request_time_ms }` — word `start`/`end` (integer milliseconds) appear only when `timestamps: true`; only the clip-level durations carry the `_ms` suffix
- **Pre-warming:** `GET https://sync.assemblyai.com/v1/warm` establishes the connection ahead of the first request (returns `200 {"warm":"toasty"}`). Python SDK: `SyncTranscriber.warm()` plus `aai.settings.keepalive_expiry` to hold the connection; Node SDK has `SyncTranscriber` too
- **30s per-request deadline** (504 `inference_timeout`). For audio >120s use the async REST API; for live mic audio use Streaming. If you need the utterance **cleaned up or reshaped** (filler removed, formatted as a note) alongside the verbatim transcript, use the **Dictation API** below instead.

```bash
curl -X POST https://sync.assemblyai.com/v1/transcribe \
  -H 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'X-AAI-Model: universal-3-5-pro' \
  -F 'audio=@sample.wav;type=audio/wav'
```

## Dictation API (short-form dictation, ≤120s, transcript + LLM rewrite)

A **separate service** (own hostname, own request shape — not Sync, not Pre-recorded, not Streaming) for turning one spoken utterance into **send-ready text plus the verbatim transcript in a single HTTP call**. Cleanup runs **by default**: filler out, self-corrections resolved, punctuation/capitalization applied. Set `llm_instruction` for a different shape (bulleted action items, a clinical chart note, a booking confirmation). Runs on Universal-3.5 Pro across 32 languages. Use it for dictation apps, voice notes, scribes, and "speak a message, send it" flows; use Sync STT when you only want the verbatim transcript.

- **Endpoint:** `POST https://dictation.assemblyai.com/v1/transcribe/live` (`/v1` only — no unversioned alias; `/v1/transcribe/stream` is the legacy path). `dictation.us.` / `dictation.eu.` for data residency
- **Auth:** `Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY` (raw key, no Bearer)
- **Body:** `multipart/form-data`, **`config` part first (required, JSON — send `{}` for defaults), then `audio`** (`audio/wav` or `audio/pcm`, ≤120s, 16-bit). The server transcribes as bytes arrive and can't start without the config, so audio-before-config or a missing config is a `400`. **Compressed formats (MP3/M4A/FLAC/OGG/WebM) → `415`** — decode first
- **`config` fields (exactly these; unknown → `400`):** `sample_rate` + `channels` (required for raw PCM, ignored for WAV), `language_codes` (**a list**, default `["en"]`, 32 codes), `stt_prompt` (≤6000 chars, contextual *description* of the audio; alias `prompt` — send one, not both), `keyterms_prompt` (≤100 terms / 8000 chars; aliases `keyterms`/`word_boost` accepted — send only one), `llm_instruction` (≤2048 chars, plain-English rewrite task — **replaces** the default cleanup; omit/`null` keeps it). No `model`, `timestamps`, `conversation_context`, `speaker_labels`, `redact_pii`
- **Response:** `{ text, words[{text, confidence}], confidence, llm_response, llm_error, audio_duration_ms, session_id, request_time_ms, sync_time_ms, auth_time_ms }`. `text` is always the verbatim transcript; the rewrite is in `llm_response`. **No word timestamps**
- **The rewrite is best-effort:** a failed rewrite is still `200` with `llm_response: null` and `llm_error: "timeout"` (5s internal deadline) or `"error"`. **Fall back to `text`; never treat a non-null `llm_error` as a failed request.** SDKs expose this as `final_text`
- **Upload while recording:** the body streams, so open the request when the user starts speaking and push PCM frames as captured (config first; don't go silent mid-body; a chunked body can't be replayed — keep audio in memory to retry)
- **Pre-warming:** `GET https://dictation.assemblyai.com/warm` (unauthenticated, `200 {"warm":"toasty"}`; `/v1/warm` also works) — same client and same host as the transcription, shortly before it
- **Errors:** two shapes — `{status, title, detail}` for most, `{error, error_code}` only for request-parsing failures; read `detail` then fall back to `error`. 429/502/503/504 transient; 400/413/415 fix the request; 401 fix the key. Client timeout 90s
- **SDKs:** `DictationTranscriber` (Python **≥1.5.2**, `assemblyai.dictation.v1`; install the current 1.5.4) and `client.dictation` (Node **≥4.40.0**; install the current 4.41.1), both from Sept 11, 2026. Check the installed version before using the SDK path in an existing project; on an older SDK, call the endpoint over HTTP. See `references/dictation.md`

```bash
curl -X POST https://dictation.assemblyai.com/v1/transcribe/live \
  -H 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -F 'config={"llm_instruction": "Turn this into a bulleted list of action items."};type=application/json' \
  -F 'audio=@sample.wav;type=audio/wav'
```

## LeMUR is Deprecated

**LeMUR is deprecated (sunset March 31, 2026 — already sunset).** Use the LLM Gateway instead. The LLM Gateway is an OpenAI-compatible API. Key difference: you pass transcript text directly in messages (no `transcript_ids`). Transcribe first, then include `transcript.text` in your prompt.

See `references/llm-gateway.md` for models, tool calling, structured outputs, and examples.

## Key Gotchas

### Pre-Recorded / Async

| Gotcha | Details |
|--------|---------|
| `prompt` + `keyterms_prompt` | **Complementary** for Universal-3.5 Pro — use either or both together. `prompt` is a contextual *description* of the audio; `keyterms_prompt` is an explicit term list. Neither changes output formatting |
| `prompt` is context, not instructions | Universal-3.5 Pro's `prompt` *describes* the audio (domain/scenario/details). Formatting or behavioral commands (punctuation rules, "transcribe verbatim", negative directives like "don't…") are **not supported** and are ignored — transcription behavior is managed internally |
| `summarization` / `auto_chapters` (top-level params) | **Deprecated.** Use **Speech Understanding** `summarization` (chaptered summary w/ timestamps + headlines) or `action_items` — `speech_understanding.request.<feature>` on `POST /v2/transcript` — or the LLM Gateway for fully custom prompts. Both SDKs accept `speech_understanding` in their transcription config (Python ≥0.64.x), so this does NOT require dropping to raw REST |
| PII redaction scope | Only redacts words in `text` — other feature outputs (entities, summaries) may still expose sensitive data |
| PII location policies | `redact_pii_policies` now supports granular location types (July 2026): `location_address`, `location_address_street`, `location_city`, `location_state`, `location_country`, `location_zip`, `location_coordinate`. A full contiguous address is one `location_address` span; standalone fragments get their subtype |
| PII audio redaction method | `override_audio_redaction_method: "silence"` replaces PII with silence instead of default beep |
| Upload key scoping | Files uploaded with one API key project cannot be transcribed with a different project's key |
| Language detection | Requires minimum 15 seconds of spoken audio for reliable results |
| English localization | `language_detection_options.localization` accepts **only** `en_au` and `en_uk` (400 otherwise, max one per base language) and applies regional spelling; the response `language_code` then surfaces the applied locale (e.g. `en_au`) |
| Sentiment analysis is English-only | For non-English audio the transcript completes normally but `sentiment_analysis_results` is **`null`** — no error is returned |
| Disfluencies | Enable with `disfluencies: true` to keep "um"/"uh" in the transcript |
| Medical Mode unsupported language | API silently skips Medical Mode and does not charge for it — check for warning in response |
| Transcript `metadata.warnings` | The `Transcript` response now includes an optional `metadata` object. When present, `metadata.warnings` is an array of `{message}` objects describing issues processed during transcription (e.g. Medical Mode skipped due to unsupported language). `metadata` is omitted entirely when there is nothing to report |

### Streaming

| Gotcha | Details |
|--------|---------|
| universal-3-5-pro turn detection | `universal-3-5-pro` uses punctuation (`.` `?` `!`), NOT confidence thresholds — `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold` has no effect (it applies only to Universal Streaming English/Multilingual) |
| `speaker_labels` overrides `mode` | Enabling `speaker_labels: true` on universal-3-5-pro replaces the `mode` preset with a dedicated diarization turn-detection profile — `min_latency`/`balanced`/`max_accuracy` have **no effect** and **no warning is returned**. The profile caps turns at **10s** (force-finalized; a turn boundary is not a speaker change), slows partials to ~3s cadence (`continuous_partials: true` restores ~1s), and sets silence defaults to 640/768ms. Explicitly-set `min_turn_silence`/`max_turn_silence`/`vad_threshold`/`interruption_delay` still apply on top |
| `format_turns` digit rendering | `format_turns=true` enables punctuation, casing, and inverse text normalization (dates, times, phone numbers) — it does **NOT** control digit rendering. Numerals like "22" are a model behavior, and lexical number output ("twenty-two") is not supported in streaming |
| Language selection | The connection param is **`language_codes`** (plural, a **list**, max **10** codes per session, e.g. `["en","es"]`). Accepted codes now include `ru` and `ko` (added July 2026). Updatable **mid-stream** via `UpdateConfiguration` (applies from the next turn; `[]` clears steering back to native code-switching). The singular `language_code` connect param is **deprecated but still accepted** (read as a one-element list). Steering biases — it doesn't lock; the model still code-switches among the listed languages. `universal-3-5-pro` only |
| Context carryover | On by default — the model carries prior finalized turns forward as context (per-session, up to `previous_context_n_turns` entries, server default `5`, range 0–100). Pass your agent's spoken reply via `agent_context` (connection-time query param to seed an opening greeting, or mid-stream via `UpdateConfiguration`; ≤1750 chars per value) so the model knows the question the user is answering. `universal-3-5-pro` only |
| Diarization revised labels | With `speaker_labels` enabled, a single `SpeakerRevision` message is emitted right before `Termination` (after you send `Terminate`), containing a `revisions` array of only the turns whose speaker labels changed (matched by `turn_order`). Text and word timestamps never change — only speaker assignments. Adds ~400ms latency at session close. Use it for the final, highest-quality attribution |
| Compressed audio input | `encoding` accepts `opus` (raw packets — one per binary WS message), `ogg_opus` (Ogg stream — arbitrary chunks; ffmpeg/gstreamer/MediaRecorder output), and `aac` (ADTS AAC, added July 2026), in addition to `pcm_s16le`/`pcm_mulaw`. For these compressed encodings `sample_rate` is optional/ignored (the stream is self-describing) — but still required for PCM (recent SDKs throw at construction if missing) |
| Session heartbeat | Opt-in connection param `session_heartbeat=true` (July 2026) makes the server emit periodic `Heartbeat` messages with `total_audio_received_ms`, `total_duration_ms`, `realtime_factor` (1.0 = realtime ingest), and `max_speech_probability` — use it to detect pacing problems and dead sessions. Python SDK ≥0.64.32 / Node ≥4.36.4 |
| Close codes without an Error frame | `1000`/`1006` close the socket **without** an `Error` message, so `on_error` never fires — handle cleanup in `on_close`. `1009` means a single WebSocket message exceeded the server's **128 KB** read limit |
| EU region | Moved from Ireland (eu-west-1) to Stockholm (eu-north-1) in March 2026. Endpoint host (`streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`) is unchanged |

### Voice Agent API

| Gotcha | Details |
|--------|---------|
| API URL | The Voice Agent endpoint is `wss://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/ws` — NOT `/v1/voice` (renamed April 2026), `/v1/realtime` (older), or `speech-to-speech.us.assemblyai.com` (very old) |
| `tool.call` field | The argument dict is named `arguments`, not `args` (renamed April 2026) |
| Stored agents (`agent_id`) | The first `session.update` either binds a reusable stored agent via `{"agent_id":"<id>"}` or sends inline config (`system_prompt`/`greeting`/`tools`/`input`/`output`). **As of July 2026 the two are no longer strictly exclusive**: a stored-agent session accepts `session.update` overrides for the mutable fields (`system_prompt`, `tools`, `input`) — the old `agent_id_no_overrides` error is gone. Still bootstrap-only: `greeting`, `output.voice`/`format`, `llm`, and HTTP-tool secrets. Create stored agents with `POST https://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/agents` |
| Turn detection fields | Use `min_silence` (default 1000ms) and `max_silence` (default 3000ms) under `session.input.turn_detection` — `min_turn_silence`/`max_turn_silence` are the streaming/LiveKit/Pipecat field names, not Voice Agent API. Both must be in `[50, 10000]` ms with `min_silence < max_silence`. Setting either explicitly disables adaptive endpointing for the rest of the session. Since August 2026 these stored-agent settings are honored on **telephony calls** too (previously ignored on phone calls) |
| Session-level STT tuning | `session.input` (type `audio`) now also takes `transcription_mode` (`balanced`/`min_latency`/`max_accuracy`), `continuous_partials` (bool), `transcription_prompt` (≤1750 chars — STT vocabulary context, distinct from `system_prompt`), `language_codes`, `voice_focus`/`voice_focus_threshold` (noise suppression), and `turn_detection.interruption_delay` (all added July 2026; updatable mid-call via `session.update`) |
| Immutable fields | After `session.ready`, **immutable**: `greeting`, `output.voice`, `output.format` — changing them returns `immutable_field`. **Mutable**: `system_prompt`, `input.turn_detection`, `input.keyterms` (up to 100 strings), `input.transcription_mode`/`continuous_partials`/`transcription_prompt`/`language_codes`, `output.volume` (0–100), `tools`, `input.format` |
| Greeting | The `greeting` is sent **straight to the TTS engine** — it is NOT passed through the LLM. Whatever string you set is exactly what the user hears, word for word. Don't write meta-greetings like "Greet the user warmly" — TTS will literally speak that |
| Transcript delta events | `transcript.user.delta` carries the **cumulative** running partial for the current user turn — render the latest one, don't concatenate. `transcript.agent.delta` (July 2026) streams the agent's own words for live captions |
| Hold-mode transcripts | While an `execution_mode: "hold"` tool is in flight, `transcript.user.delta` / `transcript.user` are NOT emitted in real time — they flush when the hold ends (on `tool.result` or `reply.create`) |
| Tool results | `tool.result` accepts an **`is_error`** boolean (default false) so the agent knows the call failed; tools can define `response_instructions` (`{success, error}` strings) to steer how the agent voices each outcome |
| Built-in tools | `GET https://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/builtin-tools` lists platform tools (currently `aai_credit_card_luhn_check`); attach one by passing its `name` in `tools[]`. The `aai_` name prefix is **reserved** — custom tools can't use it |
| Audio pacing | Don't stream audio faster than realtime — excess frames are dropped server-side |
| Session teardown billing | Just closing the WebSocket holds the session for 30s (resumable via `session.resume`) and **that grace window is billable**. Send `session.end` (`{"type":"session.end"}`) when the call is over to close immediately and stop billing — the server replies with a final `session.ended` (carrying `session_duration_seconds`, `audio_duration_seconds`) before closing the socket |
| HTTP tool `headers` | Server-side HTTP tools take `headers` as a **list of `{name, value}` entries** (since June 2026), NOT a `{name: value}` dict. Reads return `{name, last_set_at}` only — values are write-only and never returned (not masked as `"***"`). Tool URLs must be **https**; `timeout_seconds` is 1–300 (default 120) |
| BYO LLM (`llm`) | Set `llm` on a **stored agent** (REST create/update, not `session.update`) to run on your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `[{base_url, model, api_key}]` — one entry only, must stream, `api_key` write-only. `"llm": []` reverts to the managed model. Point `base_url` at the LLM Gateway to use a frontier model on your AssemblyAI account |
| Session history & webhooks | The **Sessions API** (`GET /v1/sessions`, get/delete by id — includes the recording and conversation timeline; filter by `status`/`agent_id`, cursor-paged, limit 1–200) is the documented way to retrieve past sessions. Webhook subscriptions also exist: `POST https://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/webhook-subscriptions` (events: `session.started`/`session.completed`/`call.connected`/`call.ended`/`call.failed`; scope with `agent_id` or omit for account-wide). See `references/api-reference.md` |

### LLM Gateway

| Gotcha | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Structured outputs | Supported by OpenAI (GPT-4.1/5.x), Gemini, Claude 4.5+, and Qwen. **NOT supported:** Claude 3.x, `gpt-oss` models, and **`claude-sonnet-5` at launch** (July 2026) — use tool calling or prompting there. Optional `post_processing_steps: [{"type": "json-repair"}]` repairs near-miss JSON |
| `tool_calls` location | `tool_calls` lives at `choices[i].message.tool_calls` (under `message`), NOT at `choices[i].tool_calls` (under `choice`). `content` is `null` when only tool_calls are present |
| `finish_reason` is provider-native | Don't branch tool-calling loops on `finish_reason == "tool_calls"` — the Gateway passes the provider's value through, so **Claude returns `tool_use`/`end_turn`** (OpenAI returns `tool_calls`/`stop`). Detect a tool call by the **presence of `message.tool_calls`**, not by `finish_reason` |
| `model_region: "global"` | Optional request field (only accepted value `"global"`) routes to the provider's global, non-region endpoints at provider list price — now live for **Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI** models. Omit for default in-region processing; the US/EU data-residency tiers cost ~10% more than the global tier (provider pass-through, no AssemblyAI upcharge, since July 1, 2026) |
| EU region | Only Anthropic Claude and Google Gemini models available — OpenAI models are NOT supported in EU |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| `Authorization: Bearer KEY` | `Authorization: KEY` (no Bearer prefix) — BUT the Voice Agent API (`agents.assemblyai.com`) uses `Authorization: Bearer KEY` |
| Using LeMUR API | **Deprecated.** Use LLM Gateway instead |
| Using top-level `summarization` or `auto_chapters` | **Deprecated.** Use Speech Understanding `summarization`/`action_items` (`speech_understanding.request.<feature>`) or the LLM Gateway |
| LeMUR `transcript_ids` with LLM Gateway | Pass transcript text in messages, not IDs |
| `anthropic/claude-...` model IDs | No provider prefix: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` not `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` |
| `claude-opus-4-20250514` / `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` on LLM Gateway | **Removed June 2026.** Use Claude Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.5/4.6, or Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`, added July 2026) |
| `kimi-k2.5` on LLM Gateway | **Removed August 2026** — Moonshot AI Kimi models are no longer available on the Gateway |
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` / `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` on LLM Gateway | **Removed July 2026.** Use `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, or `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` |
| Uploading to `/v2/upload` with `-d`/`--data` or a JSON body | Use `--data-binary @file` (raw bytes). `-d`/JSON returns a valid `upload_url` but transcription later fails with `Transcoding failed. File type application/json` |
| Using Java/Go/C# SDKs | **Discontinued.** Use Python, JS/TS, Ruby, or raw API |
| `word_boost` anywhere | Use `keyterms_prompt` instead — on the async REST API *and* now the Sync STT API, which renamed its `word_boost` config param to `keyterms_prompt` in July 2026 (legacy aliases `word_boost`/`keyterms` still accepted on Sync and Dictation — but send only one of the three or Dictation returns 400) |
| Using Sync STT or the async API for dictation cleanup | The **Dictation API** (`dictation.assemblyai.com/v1/transcribe/live`) returns the verbatim transcript **and** an LLM-cleaned rewrite in one call — don't transcribe with Sync STT and then bolt on a separate LLM Gateway call for filler removal / reformatting of a ≤120s utterance |
| Dictation `audio` part before `config`, or no `config` part | `config` (JSON, `{}` for defaults) must be the **first** multipart part; the server can't start without it → `400 bad_request` |
| Sending MP3/M4A/FLAC/OGG/WebM to Dictation | `415` — Dictation decodes incrementally and only accepts `audio/wav` or `audio/pcm` (16-bit). Decode first |
| Treating Dictation `llm_error` as a failed request | The rewrite is best-effort — a `200` with `llm_response: null` and `llm_error: "timeout"`/`"error"` still carries the verbatim `text`. Fall back to `text` (SDK: `final_text`) |
| Dictation `language_codes: "es"` (string) or `language_code` | It's always a **list**: `language_codes: ["es"]` |
| Passing `model`, `timestamps`, `conversation_context`, `speaker_labels`, or `redact_pii` in Dictation `config` | Unknown fields → `400`. Dictation's config is exactly `sample_rate`, `channels`, `language_codes`, `stt_prompt`, `keyterms_prompt`, `llm_instruction` |
| `aai.DictationTranscriber` / `client.dictation` on an older SDK | Only in Python ≥1.5.2 / Node ≥4.40.0 (Sept 11, 2026) — install the current 1.5.4 / 4.41.1. Verify the installed version; otherwise use raw HTTP |
| Hardcoding v2 streaming URL | v3 (`/v3/ws`) is current; v2 still works but is legacy |
| Using `speech_model=u3-rt-pro` for streaming | **Removed July 2026** from the model picker and streaming spec enum — superseded by `universal-3-5-pro` (the streaming default). From **September 2, 2026** `u3-rt-pro` connections are silently redirected to `universal-3-5-pro`. Set a different model only for cost tradeoffs (`universal-streaming-english`/`-multilingual`) |
| Python SDK rejects `universal-3-5-pro` | The SDK validates `speech_model` locally against an enum, and pre-`0.64.21` releases omit `universal-3-5-pro`. Install the current release — `pip install "assemblyai>=1.5.4"` (or `pip install -U assemblyai`) |
| `aai.SpeechModel.universal_3_5_pro` in Python SDK | Use raw strings: `"universal-3-5-pro"`, `"universal-2"` — these enum aliases don't exist in the SDK |
| `aai.Lemur(...)` / `client.lemur` in the SDKs | **Removed** — Python 1.0.0 and Node 4.37.0 deleted the LeMUR surface entirely (the endpoints answer 404). Transcribe, then send `transcript.text` to the LLM Gateway |
| `pip install "assemblyai[extras]"` | **Removed in Python 1.0.0** — the `[extras]` option fails outright. Use `pip install -U assemblyai` |
| `from assemblyai.extras import MicrophoneStream` | **Removed in Python 1.0.0.** The SDK does not capture microphone audio; use `pyaudio`/`sounddevice` and pass 16-bit PCM chunks to `RealTimeTranscriber.stream(...)` |
| `StreamingClient` / `StreamingClientOptions` / `StreamingParameters` in Python | Renamed in 1.0.0 to `RealTimeTranscriber` / `RealTimeTranscriberOptions` / `RealTimeParameters`. The old names still resolve to the same objects, so this is style, not breakage — but write the `RealTime*` names in new code |
| S2S `session.update` without `"session"` key | Must wrap config: `{"type":"session.update","session":{...}}` |
| S2S tool schema using `{"function":{...}}` nesting | S2S tools are flat: `{"type":"function","name":"...","description":"...","parameters":{...}}` |
| Voice Agent S2S URL | Correct URL: `wss://agents.assemblyai.com/v1/ws` — not `/v1/voice` (renamed April 2026), `/v1/realtime` (older), or `speech-to-speech.us.assemblyai.com` (very old) |
| Voice Agent `tool.call` `args` field | Renamed to `arguments` — `event["arguments"]` is the parameter dict |
| Medical Mode `domain: "medical"` | Correct value is `domain: "medical-v1"` |
| LLM Gateway tool result `role: "function_call_output"` | Correct role is `"tool"` — use `{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "...", "content": "..."}` |
| LLM Gateway response `choices[i].tool_calls` | Tool calls live under `message`: `choices[i].message.tool_calls`, not at the choice level |
| Sending `tool.result` immediately on `tool.call` | Wait until `reply.done` is the latest event received — sending earlier (mid transition phrase) or later (after a new turn started) breaks turn-taking |
| Speech Understanding without the `request` wrapper | Features nest under `speech_understanding.request.<feature>` — `speech_understanding.translation` (no `.request`) is invalid. Results come back under `speech_understanding.response.<feature>` |
| Custom Formatting params as booleans | `date`/`phone_number`/`email` are **format-pattern strings** (e.g. `"mm/dd/yyyy"`), not `true`/`false`. Only `format_utterances` is a boolean |
